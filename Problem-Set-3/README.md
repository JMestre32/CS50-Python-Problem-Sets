# Problem Set 3

<h3> Fuel Gauge </h3>
Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.

In a file called ``fuel.py``, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as ``X/Y``, wherein each of ``X`` and ``Y`` is an integer, and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output ``E`` instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output ``F`` instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

If, though, ``X`` or ``Y`` is not an integer, ``X`` is greater than ``Y``, or ``Y`` is ``0``, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for ``Y`` to be ``4``.) Be sure to catch any exceptions like ``ValueError`` or ``ZeroDivisionError``.
